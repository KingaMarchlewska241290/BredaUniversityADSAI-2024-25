## Creative Brief

The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) were established by the United Nations in 2015 to guide countries in achieving a sustainable future. These 17 global objectives encompass a wide range of areas, including poverty eradication, education, gender equality, economic growth, climate action, and environmental protection.

The *__SDG Hub@BUas__*, referred to as the client, has reached out to you as an aspiring - *__data professional__* - to apply your expertise in providing data-driven solutions. In particular, they require your assistance in monitoring and assessing the advancements made towards the SDGs on a global and/or country-specific scale.

The objective is to *__develop an interactive dashboard utilizing your newly acquired skills in data analytics and visualization__*. The dashboard will provide valuable insights to policymakers, researchers, and activists, enabling them to make informed decisions and take targeted actions towards the SDGs. Moreover, it will serve as a tool to raise awareness among the general public, inspiring collective efforts towards creating a more sustainable and equitable world.

Good luck!

## Knowledge Modules

The ADS&AI program is structured into 8-week blocks. On Monday, Wednesday, and Thursday you work individually on the development of fundamental skills, which are needed to successfully complete the Creative brief. In *__DataLab__* (Also see [DataLab Attendance](https://adsai.buas.nl/General/DataLabAttendance.html)), scheduled on Tuesdays and Fridays, you apply your knowledge to the Creative Brief by completing a list of tasks, which you can find [here](https://adsai.buas.nl/Year1/BlockA/DataLabTasks.html). 

The block is further divided into two phases, centered around three *__knowledge modules__*:

- [Introduction to Artificial Intelligence](https://adsai.buas.nl/Study%20Content/Artificial%20Intelligence/)
- [Introduction to Data Science](https://adsai.buas.nl/Study%20Content/DataScience/)
- [Introduction to Programming with Python](https://adsai.buas.nl/Study%20Content/Programming/)
- [Introduction to Mathematics](https://adsai.buas.nl/Study%20Content/MathY1A/)

Below you can find the timeline overview of all the weeks in this block.

*Figure 3. Overview Block A, Year 1.*

### 1. Introduction to Artificial Intelligence (Week 1-3)

In the first three weeks of Block A, you will acquire foundational knowledge and understanding of the theories, principles, methods, and techniques related to the field of AI. For example, you will be made familiar with the philosophy, history, and taxonomy of AI, among others, by analyzing a Sci-Fi movie or (TV) series. In addition, we will teach you essential soft skills, such as presenting and citing sources.

In DataLab II, Week 3, you are required to give a presentation where you identify and describe an AI topic in a Sci-Fi movie or (TV) series, and place it within the Taxonomy of AI. Additionally, you will need to evaluate the technical feasibility of the AI topic by critically assessing its possible application(s) within a real-life (business) setting. Furthermore, you will need to articulate potential ethical and/or legal implications of the AI application. Lastly, in order to meet the information needs of the presentation, you will need to acquire, evaluate, and use information from various popular and/or scholarly sources, such as blogs and scientific journal articles. 

### 2. Introduction to Data Science (Week 4-7)

To change the world, we must first be able to measure it. Measuring and quantifying what matters is a crucial component of evaluating progress. In September 2015, all countries agreed to adopt specific goals as targets or indicators for global development. Collectively, these goals are known as the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Many institutions, organizations, and companies have decided to adopt these goals. One of them is BUas, its aim is to become more sustainable as well, but how?

To figure this out, you're going to track and explore global, country-level, or BUas-level progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by leveraging data to gain insights into this progress and provide solutions related to sustainable development. Your responsibilities include framing a data-driven research question, gathering accurate data from the Sustainable Development Goals databank, conducting exploratory data analysis, analyzing and visualizing the data, interpreting the data to come up with your research findings, and ultimately presenting your conclusions to the client.

Throughout this process, you will be applying concepts and tools learned in workshops, such as SDGTracker for problem formulation and Power BI for visualization. The culmination of your efforts will be the presentation of your findings through an intuitive user interface, with a live demonstration of your dashboard to the client, staff, and peers. This presentation will also include an opportunity for everyone to vote on the best dashboard. Let's delve into the details of each step and embark on this meaningful journey towards understanding and promoting sustainable development.

This individual project [consists of the following steps](https://adsai.buas.nl/Year1/BlockA/DataLabTasks.html#task-2-define-a-data-driven-research-question).

### 3. Introduction to Programming with Python (Week 1-7)

Data scientists use programming for a wide array of tasks, such as visualizing data, training machine learning models, and processing data. Therefore programming skills are indispensable for any data scientist. There are many different programming languages, for data science, Python is by far the most common one. Therefore, every Thursday in this Block until W7, you will study programming with Python. You can access the learning material from the timeline below or find everything [here](https://adsai.buas.nl/Study%20Content/Programming/) in one place.

### 4. Introduction to Mathematics

Mathematics is foundational to data science and artificial intelligence, as it forms the theoretical backbone for the algorithms and models that power these disciplines. Concepts from linear algebra and calculus are essential for understanding the methods and algorithms available. Linear algebra helps in managing and analyzing complex, high-dimensional data, while calculus allows for the optimization and fine-tuning of models. A solid grasp of mathematics not only enables data scientists and machine learning practitioners to develop more effective and robust models but also empowers them to innovate and adapt existing methods to solve complex real-world problems.

In this block, you'll update your basic math skills, which are essential for understanding more advanced topics. This strong foundation will help you as we move on to more complex materials in data science and artificial intelligence in the later blocks. By mastering your math skills now, you'll be better prepared for the more challenging content ahead. To help you build this foundational math knowledge, we’ve provided 5 ungraded quizzes. Based on your scores, we’ll recommend specific courses to help you improve your math skills. For some students, completing the quizzes may be sufficient, but for others who need to strengthen their understanding, additional effort and learning will be necessary. In Week 6, you will take an exam to evaluate your knowledge. The grade from this exam will contribute 20% to your final grade for this block.

We highly recommend that, starting from Monday in Week 2 through Week 6, you take the related quiz to evaluate your knowledge. These quizzes are designed to assess your understanding of the material. If the quiz results indicate that you need to improve in certain areas, you'll have the entire week to review the recommended materials and enhance your understanding to the desired level before the next upcoming quiz/exam.

You can see more details along with the related topics for each quiz [here](https://adsai.buas.nl/Study%20Content/MathY1A/).
